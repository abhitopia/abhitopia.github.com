 > If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough. - Albert Einstein

 The purpose of this blog is three fold

 1. As a journal, so I can look back when I am 60 and remember what was it I wasted prime time of my life on. :)
 2. Organize plethora of information I deem worth preserving for purpose of knowledge sharing and recall.
 3. Learn better by following [Feynman Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f-qkGJBPts)


Following topics are currently of interest to me
## [Universe](/Universe/computation_speculation/)
I do wild speculations and connect information and computation to the fundamental fabric of nature using analogies, thought experiments, and at times outragious leaps of faith. Mostly meant to organise to provide a medium to channel my thought and hopefully encourage some of my genious non-existent readers to develop this idea further.

## [Tensor Algebra](/TensorAlgebra/Chap1/)
A short course (WIP) to build solid foundation in Tensor Algebra, which is a prerequisite to Tensor Calculus, which itself is a prerequisite to Differential Geometry, which in turn forms the mathematical language for Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.

## [Machine Learning](/ML/Concepts/misc)
Different Machine learning topics, including an [archive of interesting papers](/ML/Concepts/misc).
