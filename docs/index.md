 > If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough. - Albert Einstein

 The purpose of this blog is two fold

 1. Learn better by following [Feynman Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f-qkGJBPts)
 2. Organize plethora of information I deem worth preserving for purpose of knowledge sharing and recall.


The blog is broadly organized into following cateories:
## [Tensor Algebra](/TensorAlgebra/Chap1/)
A short course (WIP) to build solid foundation in Tensor Algebra, which is a prerequisite to Tensor Calculus, which itself is a prerequisite to Differential Geometry, which in turn forms the mathematical language for Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.
