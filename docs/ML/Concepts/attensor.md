### Context dependent embedding
Emb(symbol) -> Attensor(context, Emb(symbol))
- Attensor can be realised using Tensor Network


### Experiment Attensor as a substitute for attention
- Multi-head self attention
- Attention language modelling

- show that they are special cases of attensor

- compare in terms of speed, accuracy and speed of convergence vs num of parameters
